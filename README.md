# unitization

#Notes 

unitization depends on a few libraries:  
*tensorflow == 1.6.0
*keras == 2.1.5
*jupyter
*numpy  
unitization is tested in the environment with tensorflow == 1.6.0 and keras == 2.1.5. The higher versions of these libraries might work.

#Usage

Install the required dependencies like tensorflow and keras
Run Jupyter Notebook
Open main.ipynb on Jupyter
Run all the cells, and the results will be shown in the last cell
You can use a different seed in the second cell to test the code
You can delete weights folder that includes the initial weights, and run the code with a different seed
Delete test_accuracy.json that stores all the results if you run the code again
